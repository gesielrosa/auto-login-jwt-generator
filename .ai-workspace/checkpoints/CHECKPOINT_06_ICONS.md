## Implementation Notes

### Key Decisions

  - Color: #0066cc (matches extension primary color)
  - Design: Key shape (symbolic of login/authentication)
  - Transparency: PNG with alpha channel
- **Sizes**: Three standard Chrome Extension sizes
  - 16x16: Toolbar icon
  - 48x48: Extension management page
  - 128x128: Chrome Web Store
- **No Brand References**: Generic key design, no logos or brand marks

### Deviations from Plan

- No changes needed in this phase

### Challenges Encountered
- None - icons already completed
